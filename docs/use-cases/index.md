# Use cases

<span class="subtitle">

The following are some typical cases to explore how SLSA compliance can provide protection. In each, we’ve detailed goals that users need to meet, how organizations can use the SLSA framework to help meet them, and limitations that might be faced.

<span class="use-cases">

-   [Publishing a software package](/publishing-a-software-package.md) How a developer can protect their users from malicious changes to the software they publish
-   [Consuming third party software](/consuming-third-party-software.md) How a developer can work with third party software suppliers to reduce risk in a supply chain
-   [Package repository accepting a package](/package-repository-accepting-a-software-package.md) How a repository can protect their users from malicious changes to software artifacts published in their repository
-   [IN DEVELOPMENT]: Checking an artifact’s SLSA level
-   [IN DEVELOPMENT]: Determining a package’s intent
-   [IN DEVELOPMENT]: Automatically verifying software

For a [full example](../example.md) that explores edge cases in greater detail, we created a use case for using curl through its official docker image.

[Want to contribute?](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa/tree/main/case-studies) These are only a few of the most common use cases for developers, software consumers and repository maintainers.  We welcome any real life scenarios you’ve faced using SLSA in your projects.
