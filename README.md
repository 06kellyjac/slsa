# SLSA ("salsa") is Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts

SLSA (pronounced ["salsa"](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+pronounce+salsa)) is an open source security framework to describe and verify what integrity looks like, giving anyone working with software a common language and a way to work at scale.
