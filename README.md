# SLSA: Technical Controls

This repository contains an index of technical controls that fit into the
[SLSA Framework](https://github.com/SLSA-Framework/levels).

NOTE: This is still a work in progress.

## Contents

*   [Software Attestations](attestations.md): How to represent software artifact
    metadata.
*   [Policies](policy.md): Conventions for how to express security policies
    based on attestations.

## Project Scope and Organization

We recommend a cohesive set of formats, conventions, and tools to provide
end-to-end software supply chain integrity guarantees. Currently, there are
various projects in this space with overlapping missions and often incompatible
interfaces. No one project solves all problems and it is confusing to understand
how the pieces fit together. The well-lit path we define will make it easier for
users to achieve the guarantees they desire.
